## Particular Tweaks

### Steam Emulators

By default, the following locations will be scanned for the files generated by Steam Emulators:

```
- %PUBLIC%\Documents\Steam\CODEX
- %appdata%\Steam\CODEX
- %ProgramData%\Steam\*\
- %localappdata%\SKIDROW
- %DOCUMENTS%\SKIDROW
- %appdata%\SmartSteamEmu
- %appdata%\Goldberg SteamEmu Saves
- %appdata%\CreamAPI
```

If your game is not detected, you can also try to add it manually. For it, go the client and, in the `Settings > 
Folders` menu, click into `User Dir > Add a Folder.` Select any folder. Just make sure you select a folder which 
contains `appid` folder(s). 

 ```
 |___ Custom dir
      |___ 480 
      |___ 220 
 ```

In the case of `ALI213`, `Hoodlum` and `RPCS3`, selected instead a folder where the `ALI213.ini`, `valve.ini`, 
`him.ini`, `ds.ini` or `RPCSS3.exe` are located. This is also aplicable for other Steam Emulators that don't have a
default folder. The app will then parse it and look for achievement data file from the chosen location.
 
⚠️Green Luma Reborn: only if the reg key `"SkipStatsAndAchievements"` is set to `dword:00000000` for that `APPID`.

__Note:__ By default, custom folders have notifications disabled. If you want to enable them, just click the bell icon
next to them.

### Legit Steam

In the case of the legit Steam client, you can choose to show all your owned Steam games, all the installed or none 
__(default option)__. This feature requires Steam to be installed and your Steam Profile to be `Public`.

Due to the server rate limit, if you have a huge Steam library it might not get all your games in one go. If you are 
using your own Steam Web Api Key ([see **Steam Web API Key** section](TBD)), this doesn't concern you.

### RPCS3 Playstation 3 Emulator


If you want to also add your RPCS3 games, go the client and, in the `Settings > Folders` menu, click into `User Dir > 
Add a Folder.` and selected the folder where `rpcs3.exe` is located. The app will then look for ~~achievement~~ trophies 
for every game and every ps3 user. 


Note that PS3 trophies are language specific, so they will be in the language you are playing with. Also, these 
trophies, due to the console nature, does not contain timestamps.

### LumaPlay

⚠️Disabled by default. Subject to removal.

Uplay game achievements is not accesible through any public API. Due to this, there are a lot of limitations:

* Uplay client must be installed in order to try to get the game's info from its cache.
* To have the game info in the Uplay client cache you **don't** need to install the game but you need to have seen the 
achievement listing page of the game at least once in the Uplay client.
* This app will keep and send the data to a remote server to build its own cache. Once the server has the game info 
Uplay client is no longer required as the app will fetch the data from said server.
* Therefore, in theory, only newest game would require Uplay client in the future.
